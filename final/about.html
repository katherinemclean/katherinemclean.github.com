	<h1>ARTIST'S STATEMENT</h1>
	<p>Using drawing, inking, printing and papermaking I comment on mental and emotional states. I do this by playing with scenarios of social interactions, different levels of  masking and demasking  and how they intertwine. doing this allows a dialogue to begin between the viewer and the work.</p>
	<p>The ideas of self manipulation of emotions is less of an idea and more of a reality. A part of my work is making an exaggerated emotional mirror covered with dark humor and creepy fun, allowing the viewer to be apart of the piece while looking on the outside.</p>
